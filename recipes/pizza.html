<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Yeast</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Flour</li>
    <li>Oil</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Cornmeal</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Combine ½ cup of warm water with the sugar and yeast. Stir to dissolve the yeast and let rest for 5 minutes. It should foam on the top. </li>
    <li>Add the remaining 1 cup of warm water, olive oil, salt and vinegar. Begin mixing on medium-low speed, gradually adding the flour a cup at a time, and knead the dough for about 7 minutes, or until it's smooth and elastic. Transfer dough to a greased bowl and cover with a dry towel or greased plastic wrap. Allow to rise for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until it has about doubled in volume.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 450°F. If using a pizza stone, add cornmeal and flour to a pizza peel or parchment paper and place pizza dough on top (otherwise press the dough into a pizza pan). </li>
    <li>Prick the top of the dough a few times with a fork and pre-bake the dough in the pizza pan, or slide onto a hot pizza stone to pre-bake for 3-4 minutes. Remove from oven and add pizza sauce and toppings. Return to oven and bake for 5-12 more minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
